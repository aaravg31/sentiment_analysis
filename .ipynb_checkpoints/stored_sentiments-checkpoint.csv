Infosys is India's second largest software services exporter and earns more than 80 percent of its revenue from Western markets.
Infosys bumped constant-currency revenue guidance for the current financial year to 3-4 percent, up from an earlier forecast of 1-3 percent.
Parekh added that Infosys was seeing ""early signs of improvement"" for its financial services arm in the United States.
Part of India's $254-billion IT sector, Infosys saw a pandemic-fuelled demand boom followed by a quick slowdown in growth when inflation and global uncertainty prompted Western customers to cut back on tech spending.
Infosys, which has over 300,000 employees, upset markets last year after temporarily halting campus hiring in light of reduced client demand.
Despite its upbeat assessment of returning client demand, Infosys still ended the June quarter with nearly 2,000 fewer employees.

In the process, shares have managed to eke out 18 per cent gain in this period (aided by the 7 per cent upmove in the last five trading days), yet widely underperforming the Nifty 50, which is up nearly 50 per cent in the same period. However, on one metric the stock is exactly where it was two years ago – trailing PE valuation. Mid-July 2022, Infosys traded at a PE of 27 times. Today, it trades exactly at the same level, at 27 times. The inference we can make from the stock’s underperformance in the last two years is that, investors overpaid then (bl.portfolio had warned of this in reviews of quarterly results). The inference we can make from stock’s valuation today is that investors are overpaying even more! Here’s why.
Two years ago, when Infosys delivered Q1 FY23 results, the company reported year-on-year constant currency (CC) revenue growth of 21.4 per cent. Today, in its Q1 FY25 results, Infosys reported CC revenue growth of 2.5 per cent. Notice the enormous divide between growth two years ago and now? Yet company trades at the same trailing PE! Even when you consider valuation on a forward basis, Infosys forward PE in mid-July 2022 was 25 times, while it is 26.8 times today.
Considering these, while there might be a lot of buzz following Infosys results given the beat in revenue/earnings and increase in guidance, digging through the details, there is not much to get excited about. Management guidance apart, marginal reduction in headcount during the quarter (0.5 per cent), continuing weakness in North America (year-on-year CC revenue declined 1.2 per cent) imply a swift turnaround is unlikely. Further possibility of US recession, means investors must seek value before buying stocks like Infosys.
At bl.portfolio, we had recommended investors to book profits in Infosys in June 2021, when the stock was trading at ₹1,385. Since then Infosys has underperformed the Nifty 50, with 27 per cent returns compared with Nifty 50’s 60 per cent returns. As mentioned above, currently investors need to reconcile the logic of paying the same 27 times valuation for a low-growth stock compared with 27 times two years ago for a high-growth stock. When this exercise is done, the inference will be clear that the shares of Infosys are not attractive, although it might be a high-quality company. Hence, we recommend that investors wait for cheaper valuations before considering the stock for investment.  It would also be worth noting that in the earlier decade, when growth was this low, Infosys used to trade at a trailing PE of 15 times.",25c45080cebb83dc648c7a01cf9579e6,0.9872
Infosys,2024-07-01 17:18:20+00:00,https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/infosys-shares-get-price-target-boost-on-future-revenue-growth-prospects-93CH-3504154,"On Monday, Goldman Sachs updated its outlook on shares of  Infosys  (NS:INFY) Ltd. (INFO:IN) (NYSE: INFY), increasing the price target to INR1,680.00 from INR1,650.00. The firm maintained a Buy rating on the shares of the global consulting and IT services major. The revision reflects a more optimistic stance regarding the company's future revenue growth prospects.
The adjustment comes amid Infosys's recent challenges with revenue. Despite these difficulties, Goldman Sachs anticipates an improvement, projecting a revenue growth of 4% for the fiscal year 2025, which surpasses the company's own forecast of 1%-3%. This expectation is underpinned by strong deal wins that are likely to escalate in the near future.
Goldman Sachs also noted that Infosys's stock is currently trading at roughly a 4% discount compared to the broader sector. Still, the firm expects this gap to close as the demand for Infosys's services recovers. This optimism is set against a backdrop where valuations have been rolled forward by three months, despite a slight downward revision of revenue and EPS estimates for the fiscal years 2025 to 2027 by up to 1%.
The updated price target also translates to an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) price of $20.1, a slight increase from the previous target of $19.8. The new target and the maintained Buy rating suggest that Goldman Sachs sees a favorable outlook for Infosys, with expectations of performance improvement and narrowing valuation discounts in relation to the sector.
In other recent news, Infosys Limited, the global consulting and IT services corporation, has been active in making strategic moves and addressing regulatory matters. The company announced a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), pertaining to an undisclosed issue involving CEO Mr. Salil Parekh.
While the specifics of the settlement were not revealed, it represents a significant development in Infosys' ongoing efforts to strengthen its governance and compliance frameworks.
Infosys has also been expanding its strategic partnerships. Recently, the company announced a new collaboration, the details of which were not disclosed. This step aligns with Infosys' ongoing efforts to enhance its service portfolio and deliver innovative solutions to its global clientele.
Moreover, Infosys expanded its existing partnership with Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA), aiming to enhance digital entertainment experiences through the integration of artificial intelligence.
The company also provided updates on its financial performance for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. While specific figures regarding revenue, profit, or growth were not provided, the financial results were disclosed in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Indian Accounting Standards (Ind-AS). These recent developments highlight Infosys' commitment to maintaining transparency with its investors and the public.
As investors consider Goldman Sachs' optimistic outlook on Infosys Ltd. (INFY), current data from InvestingPro provides a comprehensive picture of the company's financial health and market performance. Infosys boasts a substantial market capitalization of $78.93 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the IT services sector.
While the company trades at a high Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.97, indicating a premium valuation relative to near-term earnings growth, its stable dividend growth history is noteworthy. Infosys has successfully raised its dividend for three consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for 25 consecutive years, signaling a strong commitment to shareholder returns.
InvestingPro data also highlights a modest revenue growth of 1.92% over the last twelve months as of Q4 2024, with a solid gross profit margin of 29.45%. These figures suggest efficient operations and a robust business model. Moreover, Infosys's low price volatility aligns with Goldman Sachs' view on the stock's potential for a steady upward trajectory in the market.

The revision follows Infosys' first-quarter financial year 2025 results, which revealed a quarterly revenue growth of 3.6%, or 3.1% after adjusting for one-off items. This performance surpassed the expectations set by Goldman Sachs and the consensus, which were 1.5% and 2%, respectively.
The company's recent financial outcomes indicate an uptick in the demand environment, which is anticipated to boost revenue growth for Infosys and the sector by approximately 400 basis points in FY25 compared to FY24. 
The report highlighted that all four India IT coverage companies exceeded revenue projections. Despite ongoing pressure on discretionary spending, as noted by Infosys and its peers, the company achieved broad-based revenue growth in the first quarter.
Goldman Sachs also pointed out the robust number of large deal wins for Infosys, marking a record in terms of quantity. These deals are expected to continue contributing to the company's revenue growth moving forward.
Goldman Sachs' positive stance is further supported by the belief that these large deal wins will sustain the revenue momentum for Infosys. The firm's analysis suggests that the improving demand environment, coupled with strong deal wins, positions Infosys favorably for the upcoming financial year.
In other recent news, Infosys Ltd. has been the subject of several significant developments. CLSA raised its price target for the company to INR1,747.00, following a reported quarterly constant currency revenue growth of 3.6%, surpassing the estimated 2.5%. This positive performance, along with substantial deal wins and the strategic acquisition of Intech, prompted Infosys to revise its revenue growth forecast for fiscal year 2025 to a range of 3%-4%.
Infosys also reported an Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) margin of 21.1%, resulting in a 3% EBIT level outperformance compared to consensus figures. Following these results, CLSA adjusted its Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimates for Infosys upwards for the fiscal years 2025-2027.
In addition, Infosys announced a strategic partnership with Sector Alarm (NASDAQ:ALRM) to modernize the latter's enterprise systems using cloud technology. Infosys' CEO, Mr. Salil Parekh, also reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, though the specifics of the settlement remain undisclosed. These are recent developments and investors are advised to watch for further announcements from Infosys to gain a clearer understanding of these situations.
Following Goldman Sachs' upbeat assessment of Infosys Ltd (NYSE: INFY), InvestingPro data provides additional context to the company's financial health and market position. Infosys boasts a robust market capitalization of $89.73 billion, underscoring its significant presence in the IT services industry.

Infosys,2024-07-18 14:53:02+00:00,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/infosys-beats-expectations-with-strong-q1-performance-ups-growth-guidance-to-3-4/article68418490.ece,"Bengaluru-headquartered IT services giant Infosys beat market expectations with sequential revenue growth of 3.6 per cent quarter on quarter (QoQ) in constant currency (CC) during the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024-2025. The company has significantly improved its guidance and expects a revenue growth of 3-4 per cent in constant currency in FY25, up from the 1-3 per cent it had guided earlier.
“Strong deal pipeline, improvement in key markets, and recent acquisition are building the confidence for us to up the guidance. Our performance in Q1 was strong on volumes, and financial services in the US are seeing early signs of improvement. Strong performance on the large deals front in the first quarter gives more visibility into this financial year; the in-tech acquisition also helps us in this guidance,” said Salil Parekh, CEO and MD of Infosys. “With our focused approach for generative AI for enterprises working with their data sets on a cloud foundation, we have strong traction with our clients. This is building on our Topaz and Cobalt capabilities.” 
Infosys’ total headcount fell by 1,908 employees to 3,15,332, from 3,17,240 last quarter. In the first quarter of FY24, the headcount was 3,36,294, a reduction of 20,962 employees since. Voluntary attrition during the quarter rose to 12.7 per cent from 12.6 per cent in Q4. “Our utilisation is already at 85 per cent, and we have a little headroom left, so as we start seeing growth, we will look at hiring. We are looking at hiring 15,000-20,000 freshers this year depending on the growth,” the CFO said.
About 58.9 per cent of Infosys’ revenue came from North America, with a contribution of 3.1 per cent from India, an increase from last quarter’s 2.2 per cent. As far as verticals are concerned, Infosys has shown growth in the BFSI sector. The retail and communication sectors follow behind in terms of revenue share. 
Biswajit Maity, senior principal analyst at Gartner, said, “Despite various microeconomic challenges and discretionary spending from clients, Infosys’s overall outlook remains positive as its deal pipeline remains good. A 3.6 per cent increase QoQ is a strong indicator of its performance. We’ve consistently highlighted that this year will bring growth. IT service buyers will be cautious with spending and focus on strong business outcomes. Organisations will carefully approach new projects in the first half of 2024, expecting a better environment later.” He added that over the past few years, Infosys has successfully attracted an increasing number of large deals through an effective large-deal pursuit strategy. Significant deal wins in FY24 are expected to drive revenue growth in FY25. 
Commenting about the results, Shaji Nair, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said, “Infosys 3.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter revenue growth in constant currency, surpassing estimates led by broad-based growth across verticals, while the EBIT margin expanded by 100 basis points aided by Project Maximus, also beating expectations. Notably, the company is experiencing early signs of improvement in financial services in the US which augurs well for the stock. The strong Q1 numbers and upward guidance revision is likely to lead to an upward revision in earnings estimates.”",dd149e1b205016aa05b5a5c83082a6ba,0.9979

Infosys,2024-07-18 16:40:01+00:00,https://techxplore.com/news/2024-07-india-infosys-profit-client.html,"Indian IT giant Infosys raised its annual revenue guidance Thursday after reporting a 7.1 percent on-year rise in net profit for the June quarter, signaling a gradual revival in client spending.
Infosys is India's second largest software services exporter and earns more than 80 percent of its revenue from Western markets.
Infosys bumped constant-currency revenue guidance for the current financial year to 3-4 percent, up from an earlier forecast of 1-3 percent.
Parekh added that Infosys was seeing ""early signs of improvement"" for its financial services arm in the United States.
Part of India's $254-billion IT sector, Infosys saw a pandemic-fueled demand boom followed by a quick slowdown in growth when inflation and global uncertainty prompted Western customers to cut back on tech spending.
Infosys, which has over 300,000 employees, upset markets last year after temporarily halting campus hiring in light of reduced client demand.
Despite its upbeat assessment of returning client demand, Infosys still ended the June quarter with nearly 2,000 fewer employees.
